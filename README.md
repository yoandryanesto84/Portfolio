## Description
As a student of UPENN bootcamp 
I want  to develop a Professional-Portfolio, being this the first approach of what need  to be presented to the potential  employers in the future.
The page was built taking in considerations  some good practices like: **semantic elements** and principles of **responsive design**. 
The page shows the projects that i have worked on. I also mention  projects that i facilitated in my current position in the company mentioned. I created a section which has  my contact information.

## Expectation 
I feel more interest in the dynamic part of Full Stack Development area. the prefer working with java script and its frame work and  libraries. I might specialize in back-end.
